**IF YOU'D LIKE TO TRANSLATE "FIREFLIES":**

1. *Fork* this repo.
I can't pull a translation onto this main one without overriding the original English version.
2. The only file you need to translate is `index.html`!
On top of translating the main essay (~700 words),
you'll need to translate anything under a `<!-- TRANSLATE:` comment,
e.g. the UI, the `<head>` tags, the social sharing buttons, etc.
3. Email me a link to your translation at ⓝ ⒶⓉ ⓝⓒⓐⓢⓔ ⒹⓄⓉ ⓜⓔ!
When I stop being lazy, I'll link to it from the main page. Thank you!
